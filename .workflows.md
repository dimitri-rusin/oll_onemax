This should be the step function of the environment:
```py
# mutation phase
p = lambda_ / self.num_dimensions
xprime, f_xprime, ne1 = x.mutate(p, lambda_, rng)

# crossover phase
c = 1 / lambda_
y, f_y, ne2 = x.crossover(xprime, c, lambda_, include_xprime_crossover, count_different_inds_only,  rng)

# selection phase
old_f_x = f_x
if f_x <= f_y:
  x = y
  f_x = f_y
```

I have an example script for doing the plotting (the learning curve plot and the policy plot) for the LeadingOnes benchmark here: https://github.com/ndangtt/LeadingOnesDACNew/blob/main/examples/analyse_results.py

You can try that script by following example 2:

Here is our FOGA paper published year on using irace to control the parameter of the (1+lambda,lambda)-GA on OneMax problem:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12334

Here is the algorithm in Python:

(the lbds parameter is the policy, it's an array of size n, where the i^th element tells us which lambda value we should use for fitness value of i)

Deyao (my student) also reimplemented this algorithm in Rust. It significantly reduces the compute time, we can use this one for the evaluation (while using the Python code for the training):

It was very nice to meet you yesterday. Here is the SAT solving paper I mentioned yesterday:

Another thing during our conversion was the topic that Carola, Martin, and our collaborators in Freiburg and I are working on at the moment is Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC). We focuses on developing new DAC benchmarks and using them to gain understanding the strengths and weakness of current deep-RL methods in the context of DAC. I thought I'd share our GECCO 2022 here with you as well, just in case you might be interested:
